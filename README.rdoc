= integritray

Adds a CruiseControl.rb-style XML feed to Integrity (http://integrityapp.com)
for use with CCMenu and other tray items.

== Usage
Install the integritray gem: 
  gem install integritray

Require in your Integrity application's config.ru:
  require 'integrity/integritray'
  
Point CCMenu or your tray item of choice to the feed URL:
  http://my.integration.server/projects.xml
  to view private projects
  http://user:password@my.integration.server/projects.xml?private=true
  
You may have to manually specify that this is a CruiseControl.rb-type server;
CCMenu has trouble determining which type of server to treat this as.
